# Notes üìí

The below information relates to what I personally use and recommend people consider using.

Please assess what is best for you.

# Usage for AdGuard Home üõ°

Check that you are using __AdGuard Home v0.107.36__ or later before continuing.

## DNS Settings within AdGuard ü•Ö

I personally use and recommend people consider using Quad9 (https://www.quad9.net/) as their DNS.

Quad9 tops the speed and reliability tests for my location; they offer Malware Blocking, support DNS-over-TLS and also DNSSEC.

They are also now "incorporated in Switzerland to guarantee privacy for global DNS users" (quad9).

Cloudflare's offering is also great, I currently use them in 2023.

* _(optional)_ To test it at your location run the tool: [GRC Domain Name Speed Benchmark for Windows/Linux](https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm)

### Upstream DNS servers üîº

I use:

```
https://security.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
tls://security.cloudflare-dns.com
```

for malware protection I use 1.1.1.1 for Families (Malware Blocking Only).

### Bootstrap DNS servers ü•æ

AdGuard Home will auto-populate these.

### DNS server configuration ‚öô

Check/tick the "Enable DNSSEC" checkbox and click the green __Save__ button.

## Lists üìì

Once you have __AdGuard Home__ ready and are logged in, you can use its main menu to add lists.

As of version 1.2 there's two options:

1. __Standard__ - _All modules in one whitelist (whitelist.txt)_
2. __Modular__ - _Slim whitelist (whitelist_slim.txt) and then specific modules from below_

### Standard

__(For the average user it's much easier yet not customized)__

Add one __blocklist__ and one __allowlist__ (below).

Type | Link (URL)
--------- | -----
üõë Blocklist | [blocklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/base.txt)
üìó Allowlist | [whitelist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/whitelist.txt)

### Modular

__(For advanced users it involves a much longer initial configuration)__

Add the slim one __blocklists__ and one __allowlist__ (below).

Type | Link (URL)
--------- | -----
üõë Blocklist | [blocklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/base.txt)
üìó Allowlist | [whitelist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/whitelist_slim.txt)

Then add the [modules you desire to use](https://github.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/blob/main/MODULES.md).

## Filters Update Interval ‚è±

You can modify how often filter lists are updated within AdGuard Home in the
__Settings__ > __General Settings__ page.

Set "Filters update interval" to 12 hours _(recommended)_ and click the green "Save" button.

### Disallowed Domains

_(Optional but recommended to avoid query log spam)_

* copy and paste [disallowed domains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/dns_disallowed_domains.txt)
into AdGuard's "General settings" -> "Ignored domains" at the "Logs configuration" section
* Click the "Save" button to keep a much clearer query log

## Blocked Services üö®

It's useful to set blocked services within AdGuard Home.

1. Go to "filters" then "blocked services"
2. Click the "Block all" button and then toggle off the services you actually use or will use
3. Click the green "Save" button at the bottom of the page

# Browsers üåè

A mix of Internet Browser Addons/Extensions can improve your security and privacy further.

These are best security and privacy focused internet browser extensions/addons in my opinion.

## Mozilla Firefox Users ü¶ä

Install using this [collection](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/3899969/BestSecurityPrivacy/?page=1&collection_sort=name).
